# Project objective

  This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify Amazon Prime subscribers at high risk of churning. By analyzing a sample dataset of fictional Amazon Prime users, including their subscription details, demographics, usage patterns, and preferences, this project seeks to:

  1. Identify key factors that significantly influence customer churn decisions, such as subscription plan, usage frequency, demographics, and content preferences.
  2. Build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to accurately predict which subscribers are most likely to cancel their subscriptions.
  3. Gain actionable insights into customer behavior and churn drivers to inform targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers, improved customer service, and product enhancements aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates.
  
  This analysis will provide valuable insights into customer behavior and enable Amazon Prime to proactively address potential churn and improve overall customer retention, ultimately contributing to business growth and profitability.

  Key Points:
  - Focus: Predicting customer churn for Amazon Prime.
  - Data: Using a sample dataset of fictional Prime users.
